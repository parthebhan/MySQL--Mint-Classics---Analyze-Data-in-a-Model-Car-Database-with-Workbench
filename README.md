In response to Mint Classics Company's request, I, as a data analyst, will utilize MySQL Workbench to explore the provided data model and sample tables. I will identify key insights to recommend inventory reduction strategies while ensuring timely customer service, aiming for a 24-hour order fulfillment window. My queries will focus on understanding inventory distribution, identifying slow-moving products, and proposing actionable steps to optimize storage facilities. The goal is to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making in streamlining Mint Classics Company's inventory management processes.

Project Objectives
 1. Explore products currently in inventory.
 2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
 3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.
